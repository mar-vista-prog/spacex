# ðŸš€ SpaceX Dragon Rockets Repository

## Overview

This is a simple **Java library** that manages SpaceX **Dragon rockets** and their **missions** using in-memory data structures. It is designed for educational and technical assessment purposes, following best practices in object-oriented design.
Chat GPT was used for refactoring and adding tests

âœ… Clean Code  
âœ… SOLID Principles  
âœ… TDD (Test-Driven Development)  
âœ… No frameworks, no databases, no REST APIs â€” just pure Java
âœ… Based on NOT thread-safe collections, not transactional

## ðŸ§  Functionality

The system supports:

- Adding new rockets (initial status: `On ground`)
- Adding new missions (initial status: `Scheduled`)
- Assigning rockets to missions (one rocket â†’ one mission, mission â†’ many rockets)
- Changing rocket status
- Auto-updating mission status based on the assigned rocket statuses
- Ending a mission (removes all assigned rockets)
- Mission summary ordered by:
  - Number of rockets assigned (descending)
  - Name (descending alphabetical order in case of ties)

## ðŸš¦ Statuses

### Rocket statuses:

- `OnGround` (default)
- `InSpace`
- `InRepair` (triggers mission status to `PENDING`)
- `InBuild` (for non-human builds, included as an edge case)

### Mission statuses:

- `Scheduled` â€“ no rockets assigned
- `Pending` â€“ at least one assigned rocket is `IN_REPAIR`
- `InProgress` â€“ at least one rocket assigned, none are in repair
- `Ended` â€“ mission completed, no further rocket assignments allowed
